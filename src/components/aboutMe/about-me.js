					Hello, I am 26 year old, born in BÃ¦rum, Norway. I have for the past
					two years been developing my skills in front-end development at Noroff
					school of technology. I started web-development after corona hit the
					coasts of Norway and I was forced to change my profession. I then was
					looking for another opportunity as i was currently working in
					tourism... For me, changing profession was an eye opener as i have
					always been an technology enthusiast, and getting to know and
					experience how the applications and solutions I have been using my
					whole life.
