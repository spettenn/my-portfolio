          Hello, I am 26 year old, born in BÃ¦rum, Norway. I have for the past
          two years been developing my skills in front-end development at Noroff
          school of technology. I started web-development after corona hit the
          coasts of Norway and I was forced to change my profession. I then was
          looking for another opportunity as i was currently working in
          tourism... For me, changing profession was an eye opener as i have
          always been an technology enthusiast, and getting to know and
          experience how the applications and solutions I have been using my
          whole life.
